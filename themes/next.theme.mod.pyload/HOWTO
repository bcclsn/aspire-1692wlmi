How to install:
1. go to Settings -> Webinterface and change the template to "Next", (or edit the pyload.conf manually)
2. stop pyLoad if it's running.
3. navigate to "\pyload\dist\module\web", open "webinterface.py" and find:
(alternativ path: "\pyLoad\pyload\module\web")

"default": FileSystemLoader(join(PROJECT_DIR, "templates", "default")),

4. paste the following under it:
"Next": FileSystemLoader(join(PROJECT_DIR, "templates", "Next" )),

5. delete "webinterface.pyc" (it's in the same folder)
6. Backup: \pyload\dist\module\web\media\js
(alternativ path: "\pyLoad\pyload\module\web\media\js")
7. copy content from "COPYME" to "\pyload\dist\module\web\"
(alternativ path: "\pyLoad\pyload\module\web\")
8. restart pyLoad (and maybe delete your browser cache to make the changes take effect)
9. have fun with your new Next theme
